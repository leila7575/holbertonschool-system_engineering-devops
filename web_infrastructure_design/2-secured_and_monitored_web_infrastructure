2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

This represents a three server infrastructure with firewalls to provide security, HTTPS encryption and a monitoring tool(Data collector).

1.Specifics about the infrastructure:

Firewalls: They control and monitor, and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic in order to provide security, avoid unauthorized access, security threats and they ensure compliance with security policies.

SSL certificate for HTTPS: HTTPS encryption allows encryption of the data between the user and the website, in order to enseru confidentiality.

Monitoring: It optimizes the performance by tracking performance and availability of the infrastructure. It collects and analyzes data, sending data from each server to a centralized monitoring service.

Monitoring Web Server QPS: QPS are Queries per Second, the monitoring tools can analyse the frequency of incoming HTTPS request, and use this data to improve performance.

2. Issues with the infrastructure

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level: Potential security risk because the incoming traffic is decrypted, it's transmitted in cleartext to backend servers. This lead to potential threats exposing sensitive data.

Only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes: this causes a Single point of failure, because only one MySQL server is capable of accepting writes.

Having servers with all the same components: It creates a SPOF, if a component fails on one server, it affects the entire infrastructure.
